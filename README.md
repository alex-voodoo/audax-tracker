# Audax Tracker Bot

This is a Telegram bot for tracking audax bicycle rides.

Audax is a [non-competitive cycling sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audax_(cycling)) where participants need to complete the route, checking in at controls within certain time constraints.

This bot helps "spectators" to track progress of their favourite participants during an event.  The bot uses an external data source to get data when participants check in at controls, and forwards notifications to its subscribers.
